        <h5>The Science</h5>
        <p>Aqualung Therapeutics (ALT) is developing an anti-NAMPT therapeutic antibody to treat ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The use of mechanical ventilator is a life-saving breathing device for respiratory failure, but the high-tidal volume ventilation often causes further damage to the already injured lungs and can possibly lead to death.  Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs for VILI, and our therapeutic antibody will disrupt the untapped market and address the unmet medical need.</p>
